My name is Bojan DeliÄ‡ and I am software engineer currently working on 
developing biomedical data analysis platform at 
[SevenBridges](https://sevenbridges.com).

My language of choice is mostly `Python` and, lately, `GoLang`, but I do have
experience with `Java` and `C#` in professional environment.
