title: hello world
---

This is first post on this blog, and as tradition says, "hello world" is in order.

Lets write it in couple of languages, to test syntax highlighting at the same time:
<!--more-->
## GoLang

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world from GoLang")
}
```

## Python
```python
def main():
    print("Hello world from Python")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
